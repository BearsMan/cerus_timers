# Temple of Febe CM timers
For guild wars 2, blishud, timers module

If you find mistakes or possible improvements, bug reports or pull requests are appreciated.

## Notes
- Time of mechanics should be correct +-1 second.
- Mechanics are only included up to a certain point above 80% and 50%. If you need more than that, you probably can't meet the dps check anyway :)
- Split phase mechanics are not included.

## Usage
- Place `febe.bhtimer` under `/addons/blishhud/timers/febe/`
- Enable timer in Blish Timers module.
- Timer will start automatically when entering combat. You must press the interaction key when the split phase add is killed in the 80% and 50% split phase.
